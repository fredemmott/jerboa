This is still under development, and probably not what you want to use.

Has a much more flexible plugin system, more consistent coding standards,
and is just generally cleaner.

Also has many performance issues fixed.

Working:
- Collection
- Playback
- Non-persistent playlist
- Reading collection from database
- Replaygain
- InfoWidget

Not yet implemented:
- Last.fm scrobbling
- Tray icon
- MPRIS
- Various UI things (including icons for buttons)
- Anything which involves tag reading (collection scanning, playing from file)
- Drag and drop from collection (enter in search box works, as do double clicks)
- playlist persistence
